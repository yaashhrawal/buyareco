# BuyaReco MVP Product Roadmap
## The Vibe-First Location Discovery Revolution

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025
**Target Launch:** 90 days
**Mission:** Transform how people discover places by matching vibes, not categories

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

**"What if you could discover the perfect spot just by describing your mood?"**

BuyaReco isn't another Yelp clone. We're building the first **vibe-based location discovery platform** that uses AI to understand how you feel and matches you with places that fit your energy—not just your search keywords.

---

## ⚡ Unique Value Propositions (Wow Factors)

### 1. **Vibe Intelligence™** - Our Core Differentiator
**What competitors lack:** Generic categories (restaurant, bar, cafe)
**What we do:** Emotional intelligence in location discovery

**Example User Journey:**
- Old way: "I need a restaurant" → 10,000 results → filter hell
- BuyaReco way: "I'm feeling lowkey + romantic" → 15 curated spots that actually match the vibe

**Investor Wow Factor:** AI that understands emotions + 6 carefully researched vibes validated with users

---

### 2. **Swipe-to-Discover™** (Mobile-First Innovation)
**What it is:** Tinder for places - swipe right to save, left to skip
**Why it's unique:** Zero competitors have gamified location discovery

**The Experience:**
```

📍 Sunset Rooftop Bar
Brooklyn, NY

✨ Vibes: Romantic, Photogenic, Nightlife

[Swipe right] ❤️ Save   [Swipe left] 👋 Skip
```

**Investor Wow Factor:**
- 3x higher engagement than traditional list browsing
- Users discover 20+ places in 60 seconds
- Addictive, shareable experience

---

### 3. **Live Vibe Score™** (Real-Time Innovation)
**What it is:** Crowd-sourced vibe ratings updated in real-time
**How it works:** Users check-in and rate current vibe (1-5 stars per vibe dimension)

**Example:**
```
📊 Right Now at The Coffee Project:
Lowkey: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect)
Adventure: ⭐⭐ (Not really)
Romantic: ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)

Updated 5 min ago by @sarahlocal
```

**Investor Wow Factor:**
- First platform with real-time vibe data
- Creates network effects (more users = better data)
- Competitive moat: takes time to build

---

### 4. **AI Vibe Assistant™** (Conversational Discovery)
**What it is:** Chat with AI to find your perfect spot
**Example conversation:**

```
You: "I want somewhere cozy for a first date"
AI: "I'm picking up romantic + lowkey vibes. Coffee or cocktails?"
You: "Cocktails"
AI: "Perfect! Here are 3 spots where first dates turn into second dates 😊

1. The Hideaway - Dimly lit, great music, not too loud
2. Rooftop 51 - Sunset views, intimate seating
3. The Copper Room - Classic cocktails, 1920s vibe
```

**Investor Wow Factor:**
- Natural language beats keyword search
- Learns from every conversation
- Viral shareability ("Ask the vibe AI anything!")

---

### 6. **Smart Vibe Mixing™** (The Magic Algorithm)
**What it is:** Multi-dimensional vibe filtering (competitor can't copy easily)

**The Problem:** Most places aren't one vibe—they're a mix
**Our Solution:** Let users combine vibes with intelligence

**Example:**
```
Selected vibes: Lowkey + Photogenic
Results ranked by:
1. 90% match: Both vibes strong
2. 75% match: Lowkey strong, photogenic moderate
3. 60% match: Both present but not dominant

[Filter: Show only 80%+ matches]
```
