## 💪 Motivation

**You're not building another Yelp clone.**

You're building the first platform where emotions meet location—where "I'm feeling lowkey + romantic" gets better results than "restaurants near me."

**Your competitors:** Yelp (boring lists), Google Maps (generic pins), TripAdvisor (endless reviews)

**Your advantage:** Swipe-based discovery + AI intelligence + real-time vibes + network effects

**Your moat:** First-mover + proprietary data + user habits

**Let's build something people fall in love with.** 🚀

**Document Version:** 1.0

**Questions?** Check [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for technical setup or [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for fast answers.

**Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Build fast, test with users, iterate based on feedback.

**The world needs vibe-based discovery. Let's make it happen.** ⚡
